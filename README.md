FIRST RAILS APP
=================

- scope of this app is to test and deploy a rails app on an AWS server

- problem right now being we know how to get a server up, we know about cli, we know about prog, but we are still clueless about TCP and serving shit.

- How do you give an external port for people to connect to? Do I care?
